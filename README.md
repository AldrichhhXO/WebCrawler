# Python Based web crawler

## CS156 

This is the implementation of a web crawler that will go through a website and take all of the information related to a particular stock.


## Key Functionalities

Will be able to crawl through an entire website and be able to 'scrape' any information that is necessary/related to a stock that we are watching.

Will incorporate an agent to be able to predict the future of the stocks that we watch based on previous statistics.



## Installation

Python 3 is required to be able to fully run this application.
Pip3 will also be needed as a tool to install various packages such as:
	1. BeautifulSoup (Parsing tool for scraping websites)
	2. Matplotlib (For plotting data from web scraping data, May be used for testing purposes.)
	3. PyMySQL For storing data into a database for easier reading of data



### Database Schema

This MySQL database will consist of two tables:

	1. StockData: Which will record the name of the stock and other information scraped from the web
	2. Queue: Which will keep track of all of the URLs and whether or not they have been scraped or not.
